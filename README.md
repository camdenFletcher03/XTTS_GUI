ABOUT:
This program is designed to provide a graphical user interface for the xtts_api_server project: https://github.com/daswer123/xtts-api-server
It allows you to connect to the xtts server and use it's functions through a nice GUI. The GUI allows you to choose from a list of available voices and supported languages (loaded from the server endpoint) and playback text-to-speech audio directly through the GUI. It also supports saving tts text to .wav files into a folder of your choice.

Please first install the xtts_api_server onto your machine and have it running for this GUI. You will also need to have a copy of ffmpeg installed (and setup with an environment path variable for python to see it).

ffmpeg can be found here: https://ffmpeg.org/

A nice YouTube tutorial on how to install and setup ffmpeg can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRZRXpzZfM4
